## Bidirectional Visitor Counter with ATmega32 Microcontroller
Visitor counting is a vital aspect of managing traffic flow in various settings such as conference rooms, malls, sports venues, and more. The aim of this project is to design and construct a bidirectional visitor counter using an ATmega32 microcontroller. The project is simulated in Proteus, and the code is done in CodeVisionAVR.

## Project Objective
Our primary objective is to create a controller-based model capable of accurately recording and counting the number of visitors entering and exiting a building at any given time. Key features of our project include:

## Bidirectional Counting: The system tracks both entry and exit movements of visitors.
Real-time Tracking: The counter provides real-time updates on the number of visitors inside the building.
LCD Display: A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) interface is utilized to showcase the visitor count, distinguishing between entries, exits, and the net difference.
How It Works
The system utilizes sensors to detect the movement of individuals entering and leaving the premises. The ATmega32 microcontroller processes these signals, incrementing or decrementing the visitor count accordingly. The updated count is then displayed on the LCD screen for easy monitoring by users or building management.

Components Used
- ATmega32 Microcontroller
- Sensors (e.g., Infrared Sensors, Ultrasonic Sensors)
- LCD Display
- Resistors, Capacitors, and other Electronic Components

## Future Enhancements
Future iterations of this project may include additional features such as data logging, connectivity options for remote monitoring, and integration with building management systems for enhanced analytics and control.

## How to Use
To use this project, follow these steps:

Connect the required components as per the circuit diagram provided.
Upload the code to the ATmega32 microcontroller.
Power on the system and observe the LCD display for real-time visitor counts.
